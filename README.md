# CP2112-Laptop-Battery-Reader
This simple program shows all the parameters of your battery within the Smart Battery Data Specification Revision 1.1<br />
And also some other parameters. Namely, viewing the voltage on each battery cell. Although they are undocumented in this specification, many manufacturers use them.<br />

I am using <a title="download" href="https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools" target="_blank">Qt Creator 6.0.1</a> <br />
You can examine my bad code and make your changes. <br />
Or, if you are lazy and everything suits you, download the finished release. After you unzip the zip file to a convenient location, run the exe file.<br />
<p>In order to connect to the battery, you will need a small board on the cp2112 chip. There are a lot of them on the Internet, on ebay, aliexpress, and possibly in a radio parts store near you. They are inexpensive, a few dollars.</p>

I'll tell you a secret that in some cases you can get it for free. For example, for a programming classroom in your school. I only beg you, do not ask me about the details, I do not know these subtleties<br />
And finally you need to connect GND, SDA and SÐ¡L to your battery. Be careful! Never connect these contacts to the positive terminal of the battery.
